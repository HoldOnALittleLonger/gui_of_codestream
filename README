								Project<gui_of_codestream>

Description:
	Qt5 GUI of code_stream project.

Design reason:
	just interesting.

Structure:
	[ Qt GUI
	    Middle
	  code_stream ]

Logic order:
	GUI program start ->
	fork and execute Middle ->
	GUI enter event loop ->
	wait user input from GUI ->
	send request to Middle ->
	Middle fork and exec code_stream ->
	Middle read data via pipe from code_stream ->
	Middle return result to GUI ->
	GUI enter event loop ->


	events :
	  inputSubcommittedEvent >
	    user subcommit input to program.

	  backgroundWorkEvent >
	    background process work.

	  resultReturnedEvent >
	    completed work and return result by background process.

	  guiUpdateEvent >
	    use new result to update gui.

	signals :
	  inputSubcommitted >
	    signal signature for user input subcommitted.

	  backgroundWork >
	    signal signature for backgroundWork is going to process.

	  resultReturn >
	    signal signature for the results had been returned by
	    backgroundWork.

	  guiUpdate >
	    signal signature for redraw GUI.

	slots :
	  startSlot >
	    event loop start,this slot would connected with clicked() of
	    QPushButton.

	  inputSubcommittedSlot >
	    real work have to be done when signal inputSubcommitted was 
	    delivered.

	  backgroundWorkSlot >
	    program should wait for background process return.

	  resultReturnedSlot >
	    the work have to be done after result was returned.

	  guiUpdateSlot >
	    update GUI.

	loop :
	  gui enter event loop >
	  wait for user input >
	  subcommit button was pressed >
	  produce inputCommit >
	  inputCommit delivered >
	  produce backgroundWork >
	  program enter block and wait >
	  produce resultReturn >
	  produce guiUpdate >
	  program update gui >
	  goto loop head >




Feature design:
	Communication between GUI and Middle is UNIX domain socket.
	Communication between Middle and code_stream is pipe.

	GUI-Middle communicate protocol :
	  struct gmprotocol {
	    char key_option[3];  /*  string "-k"  */
	    char ed_option[3];   /*  string "-e" / "-d"  */
	    unsigned short key;  /*  key value  */
	  };  /*  size of gmprotocol should is 12B(4 adjustment)

	GUI style :
	    <[QComboBox] | [QSpinBox] | [QLineEdit] | [QLabel] | [QPushBotton]>  QVBoxLayout
	     encode / decode
		           key value    input         output     Start process

Develop environment:
	Qt5
	C C++
	Linux 3.10
	glibc2.17
	CentOS 7

Debug or Other:
	TODO:
	<Debug and TODO.All programs are not probably no bugs.And they are also have the space to optimize.>

Complement:
	<There could place some messages as additional.Addition could explain the project in the further gradation.>

Version:
	<Version of it>
